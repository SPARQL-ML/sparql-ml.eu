# SPARQL-ML - Machine Learning for SPARQL Query Optimization over Centralized and Distributed RDF Knowledge Graphs

The SPARQL-ML project develops AI and machine-learning-based generic approaches for optimized query processing over large RDF Knowledge Graphs to facilitate the development of high-performance centralized and distributed data storage solutions.
The final output will be a set of W3C-standard-conformant tools that implement Optimized SPARQL query execution on top of centralized and federated RDF Knowledge Graphs.
