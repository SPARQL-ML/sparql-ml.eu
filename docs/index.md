Over the recent years, large RDF Knowledge Graphs have been published.
For example, the Wikidata Knowledge Graph used by Google search engine contains more than 15 billion triples, UniProt contains over 148 billion triples etc.
Efficiently querying such large Knowledge Graphs is a key challenge.
The current query optimization approaches did not pay much attention to using modern deep learning methods towards scalable query execution over massive RDF Knowledge Graphs.
Thus, there is an increasing need for looking into modern AI and Machine learning-based solutions for scalable SPARQL query processing over centralized and distributed RDF Knowledge Graphs.

The SPARQL-ML project develops AI and machine-learning-based generic approaches for optimized query processing over large RDF Knowledge Graphs to facilitate the development of high-performance centralized and distributed data storage solutions.
The final output will be a set of W3C-standard-conformant tools that implement Optimized SPARQL query execution on top of centralized and federated RDF Knowledge Graphs.
